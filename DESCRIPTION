Description: This package contains functions to classify monitor wear and
    nonwear time intervals in accelerometer data collected to assess physical
    activity in free-living condition. The package also contains functions to
    make plot for accelerometer data, and to obtain the summary of daily monitor
    wear time and the mean of monitor wear time during valid days. A monitored
    day is considered valid if the total minutes of classified monitor wear time
    per day is greater than a user defined cutoff.
