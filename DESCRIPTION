Description: The function "wearingMarking" provides classification of monitor 
    wear and nonwear time intervals in accelerometer data collected to assess  
    physical activity. The package also contains functions for making plot for 
    accelerometer data and obtaining the summary of various information including 
    daily monitor wear time and the mean monitor wear time during valid days.
    
    The revised package version 0.2-1 improved the functions in the previous version  
    regarding speed and robustness. In addition, several functions were added: 
    markDelivery can classify days for ActiGraph delivery by mail; markPAI can 
    categorize physical activity intensity level based on user-defined cut-points 
    of accelerometer counts. It also supports importing ActiGraph agd files 
    with readActigraph and queryActigraph functions. The package also better 
    supports time zones and daylight saving.
