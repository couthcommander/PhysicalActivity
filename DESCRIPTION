Description: It contains functions to classify monitor wear and nonwear 
    time intervals in accelerometer data collected to assess physical activity 
    in free-living condition. It also contains functions to make plot for 
    accelerometer data, and to obtain the summary of daily monitor wear time 
    and the mean of monitor wear time during valid days. A monitored day is 
    considered valid if the total minutes of classified monitor wear time
    per day is greater than a user defined cutoff.
    The revised version 0.2-1 improved existing functions in terms of speed and
    robustness. In addition, several functions were added such as markDelivery
    that can classify days for ActiGraph delivery by mail, and markPAI that can 
    categorize physical activity intensity level based on user-defined cut-points 
    for accelerometer counts. It also supports importing ActiGraph agd files 
    with the readActigraph and queryActigraph functions. The package also better 
    supports time zones and daylight saving.
